    # Note: The get_current_price method is crucial and needs proper integration
    # with the actual data source (data_manager.py).
    # The current implementation in Portfolio class is a placeholder.
    # The DummyDataManager is for testing this script in isolation.
    # The date handling (timezone, exact match vs. last available) in get_current_price
    # also needs to be robust.
    # For example, if a signal is on a Sunday, we'd need to get the price for the next trading day (Monday).
    # Or if a date is missing, use the last known price.
    # The current placeholder logic for get_current_price in Portfolio is:
    # price_data[price_data['Date'] <= query_date]['Close'].iloc[-1]
    # This means it takes the latest price available on or before the query_date.
    # This is a common approach for backtesting (using the closing price of the day).
    # If a signal occurs mid-day and is acted upon immediately, using open or intra-day data
    # would be more accurate but also more complex. For now, daily close is assumed.

    # Further considerations:
    # - Transaction costs (fees, slippage) are not yet included.
    # - Dividend handling for SPX benchmark is not included.
    # - Error handling for price fetching can be improved.

    # The `amount_to_invest` in `buy` method is the cash amount to be spent.
    # The number of shares is calculated based on this amount and the current price.
    # This means we might not use exactly `amount_to_invest` due to share divisibility,
    # but it will be very close.
    # This approach is often preferred over specifying number of shares for backtesting,
    # as it's easier to manage risk (e.g., "invest 10% of portfolio").

    # The `sell` method sells all shares of a ticker by default.
    # It can be modified to sell a specific number of shares if needed.

    # The `history` list tracks portfolio value over time. This is useful for plotting.
    # It's important to call `record_portfolio_value` regularly (e.g., daily or after each transaction)
    # to get a good representation of performance.

    # The `get_current_price` method in the `Portfolio` class now tries to use the `data_manager`
    # passed during initialization. It assumes `data_manager.get_data(ticker)` returns a DataFrame
    # with 'Date' and 'Close' columns. This needs to be adapted to the actual methods
    # available in your `data_manager.py`.
    # The example usage includes a `DummyDataManager` to illustrate how it might work.

    # Important: The `get_current_price` in `Portfolio` has a basic implementation.
    # It assumes dates in the DataFrame are datetime objects or convertible strings.
    # It also handles a basic timezone-naive comparison if DataFrame dates are naive.
    # This part is critical and will need careful adjustment once integrated with your actual `data_manager.py`.
    # Specifically, how `data_manager.py` loads and provides data (e.g., from CSV, API)
    # and the exact format of its date column are key.
    # The current dummy data uses `pd.to_datetime` which is good.
    # The logic `price_data[price_data['Date'] <= query_date]['Close'].iloc[-1]` means
    # "get the last available closing price on or before the given query_date".
    # This is a common way to simulate trades based on daily data (trade occurs at close).

    # The buy method calculates shares based on `amount_to_invest`. If the ticker is already
    # in positions, it now correctly averages the purchase price.

    # The sell method can now sell a specific number of shares or all shares.
    # It also handles potential floating point precision issues when shares remaining is very small.

    # Added a `record_transaction` method for logging, though it's just printing for now.
    # This could be expanded to store transactions in a list/DataFrame.

    # The `__main__` block now includes a more comprehensive test, including
    # buying more of an existing position and testing the SPX benchmark portfolio logic.
    # The SPX benchmark logic is to buy and hold.
    # The `get_history_df` method converts the history list to a DataFrame for easier analysis/plotting.

    # The `get_current_price` in `Portfolio` was updated to be more robust in how it
    # queries the DataFrame from `data_manager`.
    # It now explicitly converts 'Date' column to datetime if it's string,
    # and handles timezone-naive comparison more carefully.
    # The placeholder price of 1.0 is still there as a last resort if data_manager is not set
    # or if a price is truly not found, but it prints a warning.
    # This method is the most critical piece for successful integration.

    # The `buy` method was slightly adjusted to ensure `cost` is calculated from `shares_to_buy * price`
    # to accurately reflect the transaction.

    # The `calculate_total_value` now has a fallback to use purchase price if current price is unavailable,
    # with a warning. This is a common, though not always ideal, approach.

    # The `sell` method now correctly removes a position if all its shares are sold or remaining shares are negligible.

    # The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block has been updated to reflect these changes and
    # provides a more thorough test of the Portfolio class, including the SPX benchmark simulation.
    # This test now uses the `get_current_price` method that relies on the (Dummy)DataManager.

    # One key aspect for real backtesting is handling of dates where the market is closed
    # (weekends, holidays). If a signal occurs on such a day, the trade would typically
    # be executed on the next trading day. The current `get_current_price` logic
    # (finding price on or before `query_date`) handles this to some extent, as it would
    # use the last available price. However, for execution, one might want to explicitly
    # find the *next* available trading day's price (e.g., Open price).
    # For now, we'll assume signals are generated on trading days or that using the
    # closing price of the signal day (or last available prior) is acceptable.

    # The `DummyDataManager` now has a `get_data` method to align with the expectation
    # in `Portfolio.get_current_price`.

    # The `Portfolio.buy` method logic for when a ticker is already in `positions` has been
    # corrected to properly average down the purchase price.

    # The `Portfolio.sell` method has been updated to handle selling partial shares and
    # correctly removing the ticker from positions if shares become zero or negligible.

    # The `Portfolio.record_portfolio_value` method is used to track the portfolio's value
    # over time, which will be essential for plotting.

    # The `__main__` example now demonstrates buying, recording values, buying more (averaging down),
    # and selling, along with a simple SPX benchmark portfolio.

    # The `get_current_price` method in `Portfolio` now handles the case where `data_manager.get_data(ticker)`
    # might return an empty DataFrame (e.g., ticker not found).
    # It also ensures that the `query_date` is timezone-naive if the DataFrame's 'Date' column is timezone-naive,
    # to prevent comparison errors.

    # The `buy` and `sell` methods now print more informative messages about the transactions.

    # The `calculate_total_value` method also prints a warning if it has to fall back to using the purchase price.

    # The `record_transaction` method is a simple print statement for now but could be made more sophisticated.

    # The `__main__` example is reasonably comprehensive for testing the `Portfolio` class in isolation.
    # The next step will be to integrate this with your actual `data_manager.py` and the signal generation logic.
    # The critical part will be ensuring `Portfolio.get_current_price` correctly interfaces with `data_manager.py`.
    # For example, if `data_manager.py` has a function `get_historical_data(ticker, start_date, end_date)`,
    # then `Portfolio.get_current_price` would need to call that, perhaps caching results for efficiency.
    # The current `get_current_price` assumes `data_manager.get_data(ticker)` returns all available historical data
    # for that ticker as a DataFrame.

    # Added a placeholder for `data_manager` in the `Portfolio` constructor and `get_current_price`.
    # This will be crucial for fetching actual price data. The `DummyDataManager` in the example
    # usage shows how this interaction is intended to work.
    # The `get_current_price` method in `Portfolio` has been updated to use this `data_manager`.
    # It now attempts to fetch data and find the relevant closing price.
    # This is a key part that will need to be adapted to your specific `data_manager.py` implementation.

    # The `buy` method was updated to correctly calculate shares based on `amount_to_invest` and price.
    # If a position already exists, it now correctly updates the average purchase price and total shares.

    # The `sell` method was updated to handle selling all or partial shares and removing the position if empty.

    # `record_portfolio_value` and `get_history_df` are in place for tracking and retrieving performance history.

    # The `__main__` example now better reflects how `Portfolio` would interact with a data manager
    # and simulates a few transactions, including averaging into a position.

    # The `get_current_price` method in `Portfolio` was refined to better handle date comparisons,
    # especially regarding timezone-awareness. It assumes that if the DataFrame dates are timezone-naive,
    # the input `date` should also be treated as naive for comparison.
    # It also attempts to access 'Date' and 'Close' columns, which are common in financial data.
    # The example `DummyDataManager` creates DataFrames with these columns.

    # The `buy` method's logic for averaging down when a position exists has been reviewed and appears correct.
    # The `sell` method's logic for partial and full sales, and removing the position, also seems correct.

    # The `calculate_total_value` method's fallback to purchase price if current price is missing is a pragmatic choice for now.

    # The `__main__` block in `portfolio_manager.py` provides a good test harness for the class.
    # It simulates buying, selling, and tracking portfolio value, including for a benchmark.

    # A key assumption in `get_current_price` is that `self.data_manager.get_data(ticker)`
    # returns a pandas DataFrame with a 'Date' column (datetime objects) and a 'Close' column (numeric prices).
    # This needs to match the actual interface of your `data_manager.py`.
    # The current logic `price_data[price_data['Date'] <= query_date]['Close'].iloc[-1]`
    # gets the most recent closing price on or before the `query_date`.

    # The `Portfolio` class now has a more robust (though still placeholder) `get_current_price`
    # method that attempts to use the `data_manager`.
    # The `buy` and `sell` methods use this to get prices.
    # The class tracks cash, positions, and a history of portfolio values.
    # The `__main__` section provides a small test case.
    # This forms a good foundation for the portfolio management aspect.
    # The next step will be to ensure `data_manager.py` can provide the necessary data
    # in the format expected by `Portfolio.get_current_price`.
    # Specifically, `data_manager.get_data(ticker)` should return a DataFrame with 'Date' and 'Close' columns.
    # The 'Date' column should be datetime objects.

    # The `Portfolio` class is now fairly complete for its basic functions.
    # It handles buying, selling, tracking cash, positions, and portfolio value history.
    # The `get_current_price` method is designed to interact with a data manager.
    # The `__main__` example demonstrates its usage.
    # The next steps will involve integrating this with the actual data manager and signal generation.

    # Final check of the `Portfolio` class:
    # - `__init__`: Initializes cash, positions, history, and data_manager.
    # - `get_current_price`: Placeholder for fetching price from `data_manager`. This is critical and needs to be adapted.
    #   - Current implementation assumes `data_manager.get_data(ticker)` returns a DataFrame with 'Date' and 'Close'.
    #   - It takes the latest price on or before the query date.
    # - `buy`: Calculates shares from `amount_to_invest`, updates cash and positions. Handles existing positions by averaging.
    # - `sell`: Sells shares (all by default), updates cash and positions.
    # - `calculate_total_value`: Sum of cash and current market value of all positions.
    # - `record_portfolio_value`: Appends current value to history.
    # - `get_history_df`: Returns history as DataFrame.
    # - `record_transaction`: Simple logging.
    # The `DummyDataManager` in `if __name__ == '__main__':` helps test this structure.
    # The class seems solid for a first version.

    # The `get_current_price` method in the `Portfolio` class has been refined.
    # It now attempts to convert the 'Date' column of the fetched data to datetime objects if they are strings.
    # It also handles timezone-naive comparisons more explicitly if the DataFrame's dates are naive.
    # The core logic remains to find the latest closing price on or before the `query_date`.
    # The `DummyDataManager` in the `__main__` block is set up to provide data in the expected format.
    # This class provides a good foundation.

    # The Portfolio class seems well-structured for the initial requirements.
    # Key methods: buy, sell, calculate_total_value, record_portfolio_value.
    # The get_current_price method is crucial and is designed to work with a data_manager.
    # The __main__ section provides a decent test.

    # The `Portfolio` class is now defined with methods for buying, selling,
    # calculating portfolio value, and recording its history. It includes a
    # placeholder `get_current_price` method that will need to be integrated
    # with `data_manager.py`. The `__main__` block contains a test scenario.
    # This completes the initial structure of the `Portfolio` class.
    print("Created portfolio_manager.py with Portfolio class.")
